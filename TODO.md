# TODO

* Should Board track CASTLING_RIGHTS?
* Implement move gen tables
* Write other useful util functions
* Maybe rename types.h (maybe to utils or have a utils subdir)
* Add sources/attributions to files saying where information was learned (such as bitboards, magics, etc.)
* Ensure Square +- operators make sense
* Update names (to_string should be debug only, to_UCI maybe should be used in engine)
